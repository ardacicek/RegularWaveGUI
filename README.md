# RegularWaveGUI
Simple GUI tool to calculate wave transformation parameters according to small amplitude wave theory such as refraction and shoaling.
Inputs are deep water wave height, wave period, deep water approach angle, the depth that user wants to calculate parameters for.
Outputs are wave height, wave length, approach angle, group velocity, shoalin coefficient and refraction coefficient calculated for the input parameters and input depth.
